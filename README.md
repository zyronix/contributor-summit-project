# Puppet module for EJBCA
## Description
With the release of Puppet 6 the Puppetserver now supports external certificate authorities. This is a major step forward regarding security of the Puppet ecosystem. However configuring and setting up a certificate authority can be a complex and daunting task. The goal of this project is to automate this progress and thus make self hosted certificate authorities more accessable to everyone.

So this module setups up EJBCA, the best and most complete opensource certificate authority. It will install all the requirements and has secure defaults.
